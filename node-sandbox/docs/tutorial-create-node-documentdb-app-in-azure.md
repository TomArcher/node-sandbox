# Add DocumentDB to a Node.js app, and deploy to Azure

In this tutorial, you work with your own copy of a [todo app created and published by Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular). The sections of this tutorial walk you through cloning the app to your local environment, running and debugging the app, adding DocumentDB support, and deploying to Azure App Service.
